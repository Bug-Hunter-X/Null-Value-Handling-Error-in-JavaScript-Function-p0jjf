# Null Value Handling Error in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values in function parameters.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function does not properly handle cases where either `a` or `b` is null. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors depending on how `a` and `b` are used within the function.

## Bug Solution
The improved `foo` function explicitly checks for null values and handles them appropriately before performing operations.
